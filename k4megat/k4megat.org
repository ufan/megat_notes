* A Quick Tour
** Overview
 *k4megat* follows the latest HENP software development trend.
 
 Key components (aka [[https://key4hep.github.io/key4hep-doc/][Key4hep]] software stack) are:
 - Event processing framework :: [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/gaudi/][Gaudi]]
 - Event data format :: [[https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep][EMD4hep]]
   - Interface to Gaudi's event data store :: [[https://github.com/key4hep/k4FWCore][k4FWCore]]
 - Detector geometry management :: [[https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep][DD4hep]]
 - Simulation interface (adapated to Gaudi's algorithm pattern) :: migrated from [[https://github.com/HEP-FCC/k4SimGeant4][k4SimGeant4]]
   
** Write and run a job
Jobs are steered by a python script called =job option= file in Gaudi's jargon.
Users need to write their own job option to customize the job process chain.

The job option file contains:
1. ~import~ the services, tools and algorithms needed
2. configure each imported objects by setting their properties
3. append them to the ~AppMgr~ instance

To run the job:
#+begin_src shell
k4run <JOB_FILE>
#+end_src

** Write a new algorithm
Writing a Gaudi algorithm for a specific task is the most common development.
The development can be grouped as follows:
- Property specification :: parameters passed in in job option files to control the
  behavior of the algorithm
- Event data access :: event data input/output, or interfacing with event data store
- Service access :: e.g. detector geometry, random number etc.
- Processing :: the real computing work of the algorithm, which are formalized as three
  callback functions: ~initialize(), execute(), finalize()~

*** Configuration
- Gaudi::Property

*** Event Data access
- Gaudi::DataHandle

**** input

**** Output

*** Service access
- Gaudi::ServiceHandle

*** Processing
- initialize()
- execute()
- finalize()


* Event Data Model
=EDM4hep= is the underlying event data model, which is defined and generated using [[https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio][podio]] library which implements an event data
description language, defines template sources for in-memory representation, defines an I/O interface for persistence,
and an example implementation for ROOT file persistence.

It aims to be the standard data model in HENP community.
In this way, not only the development of components in the same experiment software can be decoupled, but also common processing packages can be
developed and shared in the community such as [[https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][Acts Common Tracking Software]].
All next-generation collider experiments have adopted =EDM4hep= for their pilot simulation studies.

A good summary of =podio/EDM4hep= features can be found int [[https://indico.bnl.gov/event/16676/contributions/66942/attachments/42858/71974/Slides%20-%20Data%20Model.pdf][EIC Software Infrastructure Review: Data Model]].
[[file:podio_edm4hep_summary.png]]

** What is saved in ROOT file
=EDM4hep= classes (more precisely, ~collections~) are serialized to ROOT file into *FLAT structure* by ~PodioDataSvc~ (from ~k4FWCore~).
When they are read back, the ~PodioDataSvc~ will assemble these flat pieces back as a usable =EDM4hep= class.

In most cases, users do not need to care about the persistence format when designing algorithms based on Gaudi, since
~Gaudi::DataHandle~ hides these details and gives users an uniform interface.
However, knowing these flat pieces may be helpful if using third-party tools (especially tools from Python ecosystem) for quick analysis.
Besides, there are other metadata objects saved alongside the collection components, which give valuable information from
data management point of view.

*NOTE:*
the data objects stored are based on current implementation of =k4FWCore=, which in turn built on top of ~PODIO::EventStore~.
There is a plan to replace ~EventStore~ by =podio= developers in the near future, thus forcing =k4FWCore= to be upgraded.
So, the current format may change when this upgrade happens.

Example scripts are provided for inspecting metadata trees.

** TODO Future development
- Current =k4FWCore= is limited, no MT support.
  - Multi-threaded Event Data Service
- To be updated to Gaudi::Functional
- Extension of EDM4hep
  - TPC may need special data model not provided by edm4hep
  - Possible to define new data class reusing edm4hep classes
  - Proposed by EIC community and [[https://github.com/eic/EDM4eic][EDM4eic]] is a nice reference, [[file:fig/edm4hep_extension.png][see this slide]]


* Geometry model
A parameterized geometry model (yet simplified) is available:
[[file:fig/megat_geometry_model.png]]

** Time Projection Chamber (TPC)
- Drift distance based on Helper surface
- Readout segmentation based on Sensitive surface
  - Readout pcb is forced to attach to a Sensitive surface
  - Drift anode surface by default is Helper, but can be changed to Sensitive (in xml)
    if no readout pcb defined
- Multi readout PCB for pixel segmentation is supported
- Only single readout PCB allowed for strip segmentation

**** Algorithm, Service & Tool

*** Transient Event Store

*** Services

*** Component-based programming

** How to use
** General Service Access
Gaudi provides two API for accessing a service:
- SmartIF :: general-purpose, low-level, bare-bone
- ServiceHandle :: better control on Gaudi usage protocols such as
  - auto create/fetch the underlying service (lazily)
  - data race protection
  - metadata management: typeinfo, python, printing
  - exception handling

The usage is similar and both are:
- Resource Handle in general sense
- smart pointers with reference counting idiom
- easy to use and can be mixed (better following one)

Recommendation: use ServiceHandle unless there is a reason
*** Method1
#+begin_src c++
  // declare a member in class definition
  ServiceHandle<ITargetSvc> m_svc;

  // intialize in constructor: (className, parentName)
  // actual acquisition of the service happens lazily in the check step
  MyClass::MyClass(const std::string &aName, ISvcLocator *aSvcLoc)
  : GaudiAlgorithm(aName, aSvcLoc),
    m_svc("SvcType", aName) {}

  // check validity in initialize()
  if (!m_svc) {
    error() << "some error message" << endmsg;
    return StatusCode::FAILURE;
  }

  // ... use m_svc as a pointer
#+end_src

#+begin_src plantuml :file ServiceHandle.png
  @startuml
  GaudiHandleInfo <|-- GaudiHandleBase
  GaudiHandleBase <|-- GaudiHandle
  GaudiHandle <|-- ServiceHandle
  @enduml
#+end_src

*** Method2
#+begin_src c++
  // declare a member in class definition
  SmartIF<ITargetSvc> m_svc;

  // create/fetch the service
  // and check validity in initialize()
  m_svc = service("SvcType");
  if (!m_svc) {
    error() << "some error message" << endmsg;
    return StatusCode::FAILURE;
   }

  // ... use m_svc as a pointer

  /* or, access the service temporarily in GaudiAlgorithm */
  auto m_svc = svc<ITargetSvc>(name, create_if_noexist);
#+end_src

SmartIF has no inheritance.

** Default Service Access
Some services are predefined and used as the default service implementation if user does not override.
These services are immediately available without user configuration.
Dedicated member methods are provided in ~Gaudi::Algorithm~ to access these services conveniently:

#+begin_src c++
  SmartIF<IAlgExecStateSvc>& Algorithm::algExecStateSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_aess, "AlgExecStateSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IAuditorSvc>&      Algorithm::auditorSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_pAuditorSvc, "AuditorSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IChronoStatSvc>&   Algorithm::chronoSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_CSS, "ChronoStatSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IDataProviderSvc>& Algorithm::detSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_DDS, "DetectorDataSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IConversionSvc>&   Algorithm::detCnvSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_DCS, "DetectorPersistencySvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IDataProviderSvc>& Algorithm::eventSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_EDS, "EventDataSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IConversionSvc>&   Algorithm::eventCnvSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_ECS, "EventPersistencySvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IHistogramSvc>&    Algorithm::histoSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_HDS, "HistogramDataSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<INTupleSvc>&       Algorithm::ntupleSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_NTS, "NTupleSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IRndmGenSvc>&      Algorithm::randSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_RGS, "RndmGenSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IToolSvc>&         Algorithm::toolSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_ptoolSvc, "ToolSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IExceptionSvc>&    Algorithm::exceptionSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_EXS, "ExceptionSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IAlgContextSvc>&   Algorithm::contextSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_contextSvc, "AlgContextSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<ITimelineSvc>&     Algorithm::timelineSvc() const { return get_svc_( m_timelineSvc, "TimelineSvc" ); }
  SmartIF<IHiveWhiteBoard>&  Algorithm::whiteboard() const { return get_svc_( m_WB, "EventDataSvc" ); }
#+end_src

** Data Access
*** Data Access Checklist
· Do not delete objects that you have registered.
· Do not delete objects that are contained within an object that you have registered.
· Do not register local objects, i.e. objects NOT created with the new operator.
· Do not delete objects which you got from the store via findObject() or retrieveObject().
· Do delete objects which you create on the heap, i.e. by a call to new, and which you do not register into
a store.
*** Object Key
- Default RootName: '/Event'
- PodioInput put collections under: '/Event', it's hardcoded
- RootNode is special

Write Mode: corret name/Path:
| name/Path | internal       | ROOT file |
| XXX/YYY   | /Event/XXX/YYY | YYY       |
| /XXX/YYY  | /XXX/YYY       | YYY       |
| /XXX      | invalid        |           |

READ Mode: corret name/Path:
| name/Path | internal       | ROOT file |
| XXX       | /Event/XXX     | XXX       |

| /XXX/YYY  | /Event/YYY     | YYY       |
| /XXX      | invalid        |           |


* System of Units
Packages like =Geant4=, =TGeo=, =DD4hep= use different system of units.
Units conversion when using these packages together may cause confusion if not a bug in later analysis.

#+caption: Comparison of System of Units in various packages
#+name: tbl:system_of_units
| unit   | Geant4 | DD4hep | EDM4hep | ROOT   | CLHEP  |
|--------+--------+--------+---------+--------+--------|
| Length | mm     | cm     | mm      | cm     | mm     |
| Energy | MeV    | GeV    | GeV     | GeV    | MeV    |
| Time   | ns     | s      | ns      | s      | ns     |
| Angle  | radian | radian | radian  | degree | radian |

Note:
- =CLHEP= has same system of unit as =Geant4=, thus in the codebase =CLHEP= unit is chosen as the representation of =G4= unit.
- =DD4hep= default units are same as =ROOT=, see definition in =DD4hep/DDParsers/include/Evaluator/DD4hepUnits.h=.
  Units in =DD4hep= can be changed to be same as =Geant4= when build with ~DD4HEP_USE_GEANT4_UNITS=ON~.
  =DD4hep= also provides a patch of =TGeo= to use =Geant4= units as well.
  This build option is also passed to sub-projects using =DD4hepConfig.cmake= (see ReleaseNote =DD4hep/doc/ReleaseNotes.md:1110=).
  By default, this option is off (also in key4hep Spack default).

=Meagat= software currently follows =EDM4hep= convention, using (GeV, mm, ns, radian) as default units.
Header =k4megat/sim/kernel/include/SimKernel/Units.h= gives a definition of these units:
#+begin_src c++
  using namespace megat;

  // default length unit
  float d = 5 * edmdefault::length;

  // default energy unit
  double e = 100. * edmdefault::energy;

  // default time unit
   double t = 2. * edmdefault::time;
#+end_src

The best practice is always explicitly specifying the system of unit when using a value, as shown above.
This applies to data read from =EDM4hep= data from disk.
This also includes the numerical =Gaudi::Property= for configuring an algorithm like:
#+begin_src c++
  // in class declaration header
  Gaudi::Property<float> m_wValue{ this, "wvalue", 25, "[eV] Mean activation energy during primary ionization" };

  // in member function: initialize(), CLHEP unit is same as G4 unit
  m_wValue        = m_wValue * CLHEP::eV;
#+end_src

Unit conversion is needed when passing numerical values from one package to another.
Conversion factors between popular packages are defined in =Units.h= as well:
#+begin_src c++
  using namespace megat;

  // EDM <-> Geant4
  auto* g4Particle = new G4PrimaryParticle( mcp.getPDG(), mom.x * edm2g4::energy,
                                            mom.y * edm2g4::energy, mom.z * edm2g4::energy );

  // EDM <-> DD4hep
  // get a position from EDM4hep root file
  auto gpos    = hit.getPosition(); 
  // use DD4hep's utility to do some calculation
  auto drift_d = anode_surf->distance( edm2dd::length * gpos ) * dd2edm::length;
#+end_src


* Random number service
Basic picture:
- *random engine* generates random number in a flat distribution in (0, 1)
  - it's the most basic stuff, thus called 'engine'
- *random generator* uses a *random engine* to produce all types of probability distribution
- *random service* provides an interface for end users configuring and using the engine or the generator

** RndmGenSv
This is the default service for random number generation in =Gaudi=.
It is created automatically (without user configuration), in a lazy way, i.e. created when used.
It's based on =CLHEP='s random number implementation.

*** Use in Algorithm development
Most of the time, user only needs to know how to use the *random generator* when developing his/her algorithm.

#+begin_src c++
  // random service is directly available by member function:
  randSvc();

  // 1. by generator interface
  auto gen = randSvc()->generator( Rndm::Gauss( 0.5, 0.2 ) );
  auto value = gen->shoot();
  // or array
  gen->shootArray(vector_values， number);

  // 2. by number interface (a wrapper of generator)
  Rndm::Numbers exponential( randSvc(), Rndm::Exponential( 0.2 ) );
  hist->Fill(exponential());

  // or initialize it later
  Rndm::Numbers exponential;
  exponential.initialize( randSvc(), Rndm::Exponential( 0.2 ) );
#+end_src

*** Configuration in Job option
The default engine is =HepRndm::Engine<CLHEP::Ranlux64Engine>= with fixed seed number '1234567'.
Engine can be customized in job option.

#+begin_src python
  # 1. Just change the engine type
  from Configurables import RndmGenSvc

  rdmSvc = RndmGenSvc("RndmGenSvc") # default name for auto-recognizing
  rdmSvc.Engine = "HepRndm::Engine<CLHEP::HepJamesRandom>"

  AppMgr.ExtSvc +=[rdmSvc]

  # 2. Also customized the engine params
  from Configurables import HepRndm__Engine_CLHEP__HepJamesRandom_

  rdmEngine = HepRndm__Engine_CLHEP__HepJamesRandom_("RndmGenSvc.Engine") # default name for auto-recognizing
  rdmEngine.SetSingleton = True
  rdmEngine.Seeds = [5685]

  AppMgr.ExtSvc +=[rdmEngine]

  # optional: pass the name to rdmSvc for correct messaging
  rdmSvc.Engine = rdmEngine.name()
#+end_src

** About Gaudi
The [[https://gaudi-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][official documentation]] is a combination of legacy compatibility and latest development.
